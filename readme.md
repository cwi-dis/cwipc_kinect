# cwipc_kinect


This project has software for capturing point clouds using Microsoft Azure Kinect cameras, _k4a_ for short. The software turns k4a depth- and colorframes into cwipc pointclouds.

> The Azure Kinect cameras can no longer be purchased, and are no longer supported. As of 2026 the cwipc kinect capturer can still be built on
> Windows 11, but not on other platforms any more.

It is usually built or installed as part of the _cwipc_ suite, <https://github.com/cwi-dis/cwipc>.
