# This is a workaround for the change in DLL loading semantics on Windows since Python 3.8
# Python no longer uses the PATH environment variable to load dependent dlls but only
# its own set. For that reason we list here a set of dependencies that we know are needed,
# find those on PATH, and add the directories where those DLLs are located while loading our
# DLL.
# The list does not have to be complete, as long as at least one DLL from each directory needed
# is listed.
# Dependencies of cwipc_util are automatically added.
# NOTE: this list must be kept up-to-date otherwise loading DLLs will fail with
# an obscure message "Python could not find module .... or one of its dependencies"
